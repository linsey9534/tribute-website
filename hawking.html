        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I was 14 years old when I read Stephen Hawkings book "A Brief History of Time". His book ignighted a drive in
        me to learn more about our universe. That drive is still alive in me to this day. I have selected several key
        points in his life for this tribute page. If you would like to learn more you can click on the link located at
        the bottom of this page.</p>

        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Born January 8, in Oxford, England. This was the 300th anniversary the death of Galileo.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the age of 17 Stephen was awarded a scholorship to the University of Oxford.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stephen William Hawking (1942-2018) was a renowned theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author. Born in Oxford, England, Hawking showed an early interest in the sciences and mathematics.
        </p>
        <P>
            Graduated with Honors in Natural Science from Oxford and began graduate work at Trinity Hall,
          Cambridge.
        </P>
        <p>
            Despite being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease (ALS) at the age of 21, Hawking continued his studies and research, defying the odds and becoming one of the most brilliant minds in theoretical physics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hawking's work included groundbreaking contributions to the understanding of black holes, the nature of the universe, and the development of the theory of everything.
        </p>
        <P>
            Received a computer program called the "Equalizer" from Walter Wotosz, CEO of Words Plus. The
          Equalizer ran on an Apple II computer linked to a speech synthesizer. He could communicate approximately 15
          words per minute using a hand clicker.

        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <p>
            Stephen Hawking's contributions to the scientific community are immense. His work on black holes, Hawking radiation, and the nature of time and space have left an indelible mark on the field of theoretical physics.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1971 he suggested the formation, following the big bang, of numerous objects containing as much as one billion tons of mass but occupying only the space of a proton.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hawking's best-known book, "A Brief History of Time," brought complex scientific concepts to a general audience, making him a popular and influential figure beyond the scientific community.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout his career, Hawking received numerous awards and honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and he held the prestigious Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.
        </p>
        <p>
            His publications included The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time (1973; coauthored with G.F.R. Ellis), Superspace and Supergravity (1981), The Very Early Universe (1983), and the best sellers A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes (1988), The Universe in a Nutshell (2001), A Briefer History of Time (2005), and The Grand Design (2010; coauthored with Leonard Mlodinow).
